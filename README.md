# JolumOS
My own operating system that @UnbuiltAlmond8 wrote for me, allowing me to control SB's Awesome World much easier.

# Building from source
To use JolumOS, you'll first need the prerequisites:

- Have TurboWarp, which you can get from turbowarp.org
- Have 7zip, which you can get from www.7-zip.org
- Have Git installed, which you can get from git-scm.com

Next, you'll run this one-liner:
```batch
git clone https://github.com/EimaJolum/JolumOS & cd JolumOS/assets & move * .. & cd.. & del assets & del README.md & 7z a -tzip JolumOS.sb3 * & JolumOS.sb3
y
```

Once done, you can use and edit the source code however you want.
Enjoy!
